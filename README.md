# Hey, I'm Youssef ⚡

Developer. Builder. Occasional Superman.  
I write code because it’s the closest thing humans have to superpowers.  
My motto: **“Coding lets you do anything.”**

I turn ideas into apps — fast, clean, and with a level of polish I’m quietly proud of.  
I care about systems that **perform well, scale smoothly, and stay cost-efficient in the long run.**

### 🛠️ What I'm good at
- **Frontend:** Crafting smooth, responsive UIs with React, Next.js, TypeScript & Tailwind  
- **Backend:** Building robust APIs and services with Node.js, Express, FastAPI & Python  
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, CI/CD, deployments that don’t become expensive surprises  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Prisma, Redis, structured for speed and affordability  
- **Architecture:** Turning messy ideas into clean and clear systems that scale without heavy bills  
- **AI & Audio:** Model integration, optimized processing pipelines, automation that just works  

### 🔥 What I love building
- High-performance web apps that feel effortless  
- Real-time and event-driven systems  
- Developer tools with clean UX and solid engineering behind them  
- Scalable, maintainable, **cost-effective** architectures built to last
